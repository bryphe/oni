- Create API for StatusBar
- Create state for status bar in redux store
- Create StatusBar react component as part of external UI
    - Refactor some of the pieces in `index.tsx` to a <NeovimEditor /> react component
        - Pass in `Pluginmanager` as a dependency
        - Change `resize` behavior - listen to DOM element mutation directly, instead of window resize
        - Make sure on `unmount` neovim gets disposed + render loop is removed
- Create way for plugins to get settings (and be notified of settings changes)
- Create `git` status bar component to show current branch
- Create `core` integration to show 
- Add sample `weather` statusbar plugin
- Show filename

- Will eventually need to decouple the `Services` from individual Neovim instances
