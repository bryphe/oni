- Update codepath when all browser windows are closed, to wait for creation of a window

- Update `createWindow` to return a promise once the window is fully initialized

- Can we call `updateMenu` / `buildMenu` when windows are created (with a function returning the current active window)?
- Is there an easy way to get the active window currently?
